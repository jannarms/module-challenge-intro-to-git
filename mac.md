## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is an open-source program for tracking changes in text 
files.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is the core 
technology that Github is built on top of. GitHub is the social and user 
interface. 
3. Why do we create a branch? Creating a branch is a good way to ensure 
that everyone's work is safe while you contribute. Branches allow you to 
separate your work from the main branch. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull 
Request? The purpose of a pull request is to notify your team that you 
have work 
that needs to be reviewed. Once it's reviewed by a team member, they can 
either leave you feedback for further changes or they can merge your
request so that your changes get deployed. 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example 
you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back 
to main. git checkout main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. 
What does each command do? git fetch - downloads the changes from remote 
to your local repository ; git pull - downloads changes and merges them 
into your current branch; git merge - incorporates changes from the named 
commits. 
7. What is a merge conflict? Occurs when competing changes are made to the 
same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person 
deletes the same file.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? You can resolve simple merge 
conflicts that involve competing line changes on GitHub, using the 
conflict editor.
You can only resolve merge conflicts on GitHub that are caused by 
competing line changes, such as when people make different changes to the 
same line of the same file on different branches in your Git repository. 
For all other types of merge conflicts, you must resolve the conflict 
locally on the command line.
